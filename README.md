# 🧠 AI Chatbot Using Deep Learning & Flask

This project is a machine-learning based chatbot that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Neural Networks to understand user queries and respond with the correct intent. A Flask backend serves the trained TensorFlow model and renders a simple web UI for chatting.  

## 🚀 Features    

✔️ Deep learning model trained using TensorFlow/Keras

✔️ Intent-based responses using Intents.json  
 
✔️ NLP preprocessing (tokenizing, stemming, bag-of-words)

✔️ SQLite database (database.db) for storing chat logs

✔️ Flask API to handle predictions

✔️ Simple and clean HTML UI

✔️ Fully customizable intents and training dataset

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Component	Technology
Backend	Python, Flask
ML Model	TensorFlow / Keras
NLP	NLTK / Tokenization / BoW
Database	SQLite
Frontend	HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## 🧩 How It Works

User enters a message in the UI.

Flask sends the text to the ML model.

NLP pipeline converts the text to Bag-of-Words.

Model predicts the intent label.

Chatbot returns the mapped response from Intents.json.
